# EBB Sense
  Controlling a wearable display using a bitalino EDA sensor

### Wearable
- Arduino Code

### Serial Graph
- Graph the data from the arduino code running over SErial port
- Scale using up and down keys

### Hardware

![Custom PCB](https://github.com/Noura/ebbsense/blob/master/images/beautifulPCB_simplified-01.jpg)

- Eagle schematic and board
- Current version is 2.1

Each pinstripe had about 2-7Ω resistance and received about 450mA from a 3.7V LiPo battery via an Adafruit Powerboost 5V regulator, switching on (100% duty cycle) or off (0%) with a transistor controlled by Arduino pins. Each pinstripe consists of a single conductive thread. Snaps on the inside of the shirt provided removable but secure electrical connections to the thread endpoints. A Bitalino skin conductance sensor was placed on the back of the left shoulder of the shirt to hide the sensor from public view and secure it within the shirt.
